Voting is a fundamental democratic activity. Many experts believe that paper balloting is the only appropriate method to ensure everyone‚Äôs right to vote. But this method is prone to errors and abuse. Many nations utilize digital voting methods to solve the difficulties of paper balloting. A single flaw in digital voting may lead to massive vote-rigging. Election voting methods must be legal, accurate, safe, and convenient. However, issues with digital voting methods may restrict acceptance. Due to its end-to-end verification capabilities, blockchain technology was developed to address these problems. To guarantee We have used blockchain technology for anonymity, privacy, verifiability, mobility, integrity, security, and fairness in voting.
